The **ICARO** (_Traff**I**c and urbanization effe**C**ts on temper**A**ture in the u**R**ban envir**O**nment_ ) Project has started on June 2017 as input of the [D4CA] - [DATA FOR CLIMATE ACTION CHALLENGE]. D4CA challenge is promoted by the [UN GLOBAL PULSE] and aims to _connects researchers around the world with data and tools from leading companies to enable data-driven climate solutions_.

### Project Purpose
The general purpose of this project is to disclose evidence of the direct anthropogenic influence on urban heating patterns by developing and testing of original data analysis frameworks. These are prototyped to take advantage from the geospatial information available from new and heterogenous data sources, namely: high-resolution open and proprietary Earth Observations (EO), open data catalogues provided by pubblic amministrations, environmental sensors and geo-crowdsourcing. Particular consideration is given to the use of [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)] as data analysis tools to enhance both replicability as well as further improvement through possible feedbacks and reviews by the scientific community to which full access to the procedure pipelines is guaranted. 

### Initial case study
The preliminary data and analysis frameworks are developed for the city of Milan (Italy)
