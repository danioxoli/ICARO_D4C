# ICARO  

The **ICARO** (_**T**raff**I**c and urbanization effe**C**ts on temper**A**ture in the u**R**ban envir**O**nment_ ) Project has started on June 2017 as input of the [D4CA] - [DATA FOR CLIMATE ACTION CHALLENGE]. This challenge is promoted by the [UN GLOBAL PULSE] and aims to _connects researchers around the world with data and tools from leading companies to enable data-driven climate solutions_.

The purpose of the project is to disclose evidence of the direct anthropogenic influence on urban heating patterns by developing and testing of original analysis frameworks. These are prototyped to include an extensive use geospatial information collected from etherogenous sources, namely: high-resolution open and proprietary Earth Observations (EO), open data provided by pubblic amministrations, environmental sensors and geo-crowdsourcing. Particular consideration is given to the use of [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)] as analysis tools to enhance both replicability as well as further improvement through feedbacks and reviews from the researchers' community to which is guarante the full access to the procedure pipelines. 

The preliminary data and analysis frameworks are developed for the city of Milan (Italy)
